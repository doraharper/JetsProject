## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

###Description

Put together an airfield with an array of 15 jets. Built 5 different aircraft and assigned positions in the array as well as make a method that allows user to make/build their own aircraft which is added to the array. I had a good amount of aha-moments that and then I still feel like I need to look stuff up a lot to be capable of implementing certain things without being led. 


###Technologies Used

Arrays, for loops, do-while loops, interfaces.
